# CV

This is my personal CV website.
The initial site structure is created while trying to understand the basics of web development,
and will be updated and changed following the learning curve.
Multiple reasons for creating this project include  practice and deeper understanding of the tech, personal growth, creating time proof and presentation
ready job-application CV website which will be a part of the initial contact with future companies.
